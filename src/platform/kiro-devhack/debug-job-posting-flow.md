# Debug Job Posting Data Flow

## Expected Data Flow

1. **Job Posting Service** returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "job": { /* JobPosting object */ },
    "analysis": { /* JobAnalysisResult object */ }
  }
}
```

2. **API Route** wraps this with `createSecureAPIResponse`:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "job": { /* JobPosting object */ },
    "analysis": { /* JobAnalysisResult object */ }
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-08-28T20:44:36.637Z"
}
```

3. **Frontend Form** receives this and calls `onSuccess(result.data)`

4. **Success Component** should receive:
```json
{
  "job": { /* JobPosting object */ },
  "analysis": { /* JobAnalysisResult object */ }
}
```

## Current Issue

The success component is showing "Job data is missing" which means `jobResult.job` is undefined.

## Debugging Steps

1. Added logging to see what the form receives from API
2. Added logging to see what the success component receives
3. Added fallback handling in case the data structure is different

## Next Steps

Test job posting again to see the debug output and identify where the data structure breaks.
