# Auth and Dynamic Matching Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication Error in API Routes ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: `(0 , __TURBOPACK__imported__module__$5b$project$5d2f$src$2f$lib$2f$auth$2e$ts__$5b$app$2d$rsc$5d$__$28$ecmascript$29$__.auth) is not a function`

**Root Cause**: Better-auth requires different patterns for API routes vs page components.

**Solution**: Updated API routes to use `auth.api.getSession()` instead of `auth()`:

```typescript
// Before (incorrect for API routes)
const session = await auth();

// After (correct for API routes)
const session = await auth.api.getSession({
  headers: request.headers,
});
```

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/app/api/recruiter/jobs/[id]/candidates/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/debug/candidate-matching/route.ts`

### 2. Dynamic Candidate Updates ✅ ENHANCED

**Problem**: New candidates added to database weren't appearing in recruiter views until manual refresh.

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### A. Cache Invalidation System
- Added `invalidateAllCandidateCaches()` method to candidate matching service
- Automatically invalidates caches when new candidates are created
- Added `refresh=true` parameter to force fresh data

#### B. Auto-Refresh Mechanisms
- **Initial Load**: Candidate list now force-refreshes on first load
- **Filter Changes**: Force refresh when filters are applied
- **Manual Refresh**: Enhanced refresh button functionality

#### C. Real-time Data Flow
```
New Candidate Added → Cache Invalidated → Next View Shows Updated Results
```

## How the Dynamic System Works

### 1. Candidate Creation Flow
```
1. Click "Create Test Candidates" → Creates 5 candidates with skills
2. System invalidates all candidate matching caches
3. Next time any recruiter views candidates → Fresh data is fetched
```

### 2. Job-Candidate Matching Flow
```
1. Recruiter posts job with skills (e.g., "JavaScript", "React")
2. System scans user_skills table for matching skills
3. Calculates match scores based on proficiency scores
4. Ranks candidates by: (Required Skills Match × 70%) + (Preferred Skills Match × 30%)
5. Applies proficiency multiplier (0.7-1.3x based on skill proficiency)
```

### 3. Dynamic Updates
```
New Candidate → Skills Added → Cache Cleared → Appears in Next Search
```

## Test Candidates Created

When you click "Create Test Candidates", the system creates:

1. **Alice Johnson** - Frontend focused
   - JavaScript (85%), React (90%), Node.js (75%), TypeScript (80%), Python (70%)

2. **Bob Smith** - Backend/DevOps focused  
   - Python (95%), Django (85%), PostgreSQL (80%), Docker (75%), AWS (70%)

3. **Carol Davis** - Java enterprise focused
   - Java (90%), Spring Boot (85%), MySQL (80%), Kubernetes (75%), Jenkins (70%)

4. **David Wilson** - Frontend specialist
   - React (88%), Vue.js (82%), JavaScript (90%), CSS (85%), HTML (95%)

5. **Eva Martinez** - Data science focused
   - Python (85%), Machine Learning (80%), TensorFlow (75%), Data Analysis (90%), SQL (85%)

## Expected Matching Results

For a job requiring **"JavaScript, React, Node.js"**:
- **Alice Johnson**: ~85% match (has all 3 skills with high proficiency)
- **David Wilson**: ~80% match (has JavaScript + React, missing Node.js)
- **Others**: Lower matches based on skill overlap

## Testing the System

### Step-by-Step Test:
1. **Go to recruiter dashboard**
2. **Click "Create Test Candidates"** → Creates 5 candidates
3. **Post a job** with skills like "JavaScript", "React", "Python"
4. **Click "View Candidates"** → Should show ranked candidates immediately
5. **Check match scores** → Should see 40-90% matches based on skill overlap

### Verification Points:
- ✅ No more auth errors when viewing candidates
- ✅ Candidates appear immediately after creation
- ✅ Match scores reflect actual skill proficiency
- ✅ Rankings change based on job requirements
- ✅ New candidates automatically appear in future searches

## Current Status: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL

The system now provides:
- **Real-time candidate matching** based on skill proficiency
- **Dynamic updates** when new candidates join
- **Intelligent ranking** using proficiency scores and skill depth
- **No authentication errors** in candidate views

Recruiters can now see ranked candidates immediately after posting jobs, and the system automatically includes new candidates as they're added to the database.
