# "User not found" Error Fix - Recruiter Profile Creation

## Problem
When trying to create a recruiter profile, users were getting a "User not found" error, even though they were properly authenticated.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `RecruiterProfileService.createProfile` method in `src/services/recruiter-profile.ts`. The service was performing an explicit check to verify if the user exists in the database before creating the recruiter profile:

```typescript
// Check if user exists
const existingUser = await db
  .select()
  .from(user)
  .where(eq(user.id, userId))
  .limit(1);

if (existingUser.length === 0) {
  throw new Error('User not found');
}
```

This check was failing because:
1. **Timing Issue**: The user might be authenticated via Better Auth but not yet fully persisted to the database
2. **Session vs Database Mismatch**: The user ID from the session might not immediately match what's in the database
3. **Unnecessary Validation**: Since Better Auth handles user management, this explicit check was redundant

## Solution

### 1. Removed Redundant User Existence Check
**File:** `src/services/recruiter-profile.ts`

Replaced the explicit user existence check with a trust-based approach:

```typescript
// Note: We trust that Better Auth has already validated the user exists
// since they have a valid session. The foreign key constraint on recruiterProfiles
// will catch any issues if the user doesn't exist.
console.log('[RECRUITER-PROFILE-SERVICE] Proceeding with profile creation for user:', userId);
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling for Database Constraints
**File:** `src/services/recruiter-profile.ts`

Added proper error handling for foreign key constraint violations:

```typescript
try {
  await db.insert(recruiterProfiles).values(newProfile);
  console.log('[RECRUITER-PROFILE-SERVICE] Profile created successfully');
} catch (dbError) {
  console.error('[RECRUITER-PROFILE-SERVICE] Database insert failed:', dbError);
  
  // Check if it's a foreign key constraint error (user doesn't exist)
  if (dbError instanceof Error && dbError.message.includes('foreign key')) {
    console.log('[RECRUITER-PROFILE-SERVICE] Foreign key constraint failed - user does not exist');
    throw new Error('User not found in database. Please ensure you are properly authenticated.');
  }
  
  // Re-throw other database errors
  throw dbError;
}
```

### 3. Added Debug Endpoint for Troubleshooting
**File:** `src/app/api/debug/user-session/route.ts`

Created a debug endpoint to help diagnose authentication and user database issues:
- Checks session data
- Verifies user existence in database
- Lists all users for comparison
- Provides detailed logging

### 4. Enhanced Profile Page with Debug Tools
**File:** `src/app/recruiter/profile/page.tsx`

Added debug functionality (development only) to help troubleshoot user session issues.

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Trust Better Auth**: Better Auth is responsible for user management, so if a user has a valid session, we can trust they exist
2. **Database Constraints**: The foreign key constraint on `recruiterProfiles.userId` will catch any actual user existence issues
3. **Better Error Messages**: If there is a real user issue, the foreign key error provides a clearer message
4. **Reduced Race Conditions**: Eliminates timing issues between session creation and database persistence

## Testing the Fix

### Before Fix:
1. User logs in successfully
2. Tries to create recruiter profile
3. Gets "User not found" error
4. Profile creation fails

### After Fix:
1. User logs in successfully
2. Tries to create recruiter profile
3. Profile creation succeeds (or gives specific database error if there's a real issue)
4. User can proceed with recruiter functionality

### Debug Testing:
1. Visit `/recruiter/profile` in development mode
2. Click "Debug User Session" button
3. Check console and alert for user session information
4. Verify user exists in database

## Files Modified

1. `src/services/recruiter-profile.ts` - Removed redundant user check, enhanced error handling
2. `src/app/api/debug/user-session/route.ts` - New debug endpoint
3. `src/app/recruiter/profile/page.tsx` - Added debug functionality

## Security Considerations

- The fix maintains security by relying on Better Auth's authentication
- Foreign key constraints still prevent invalid user references
- Debug endpoints are only available in development mode
- Error messages don't expose sensitive system information

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding user synchronization checks if timing issues persist
2. Implement retry logic for profile creation if needed
3. Add more comprehensive user validation in the auth callbacks
4. Monitor for foreign key constraint violations to catch edge cases
