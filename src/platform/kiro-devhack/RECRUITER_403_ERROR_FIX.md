# Recruiter 403 Error Fix - Complete

## Problem
Users were getting HTTP 403 Forbidden errors when trying to access the recruiter job posting page without having created a recruiter profile first.

## Root Cause
The security middleware in `src/lib/security.ts` was not properly validating recruiter roles. The `SecurityAuth.requireRole` method was returning a placeholder role without actually checking if the user had a recruiter profile.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Role Validation in Security Middleware
**File:** `src/lib/security.ts`

Updated the `SecurityAuth.requireRole` method to actually check for recruiter profile existence:

```typescript
static async requireRole(
  request: NextRequest, 
  requiredRole: 'candidate' | 'recruiter' | 'admin'
): Promise<{ userId: string; email: string; role: string }> {
  const user = await this.requireAuth(request);
  
  // Check role based on profile existence
  if (requiredRole === 'recruiter') {
    // Import here to avoid circular dependency
    const { recruiterProfileService } = await import('~/services/recruiter-profile');
    const hasRecruiterProfile = await recruiterProfileService.hasProfile(user.userId);
    
    if (!hasRecruiterProfile) {
      throw new AuthorizationError('Recruiter profile required. Please create a recruiter profile first.');
    }
  }
  
  return {
    ...user,
    role: requiredRole,
  };
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Dashboard Error Handling
**File:** `src/app/recruiter/_modules/recruiter-dashboard.tsx`

Added proper error handling for the case where users don't have a recruiter profile:

- Detects 403/404 errors from API calls
- Shows a user-friendly profile creation prompt instead of a generic error
- Provides direct link to profile creation page
- Includes refresh functionality

### 3. Consistent API Error Responses
**File:** `src/app/api/recruiter/jobs/stats/route.ts`

Updated the stats API to return consistent 403 errors (instead of 404) when recruiter profile is missing, matching the jobs API behavior.

## User Experience Flow

### Before Fix:
1. User visits `/recruiter` page
2. Dashboard tries to load job data
3. API returns 403 Forbidden error
4. User sees generic error message with no clear next steps

### After Fix:
1. User visits `/recruiter` page
2. Dashboard detects missing recruiter profile
3. Shows friendly "Create Your Recruiter Profile" message
4. Provides clear call-to-action button to create profile
5. User can create profile and return to dashboard

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/security.ts` - Fixed role validation logic
2. `src/app/recruiter/_modules/recruiter-dashboard.tsx` - Enhanced error handling and UI
3. `src/app/api/recruiter/jobs/stats/route.ts` - Consistent error responses

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Without Recruiter Profile:**
   - Log in as a user without a recruiter profile
   - Visit `/recruiter`
   - Should see profile creation prompt instead of 403 error

2. **With Recruiter Profile:**
   - Create a recruiter profile at `/recruiter/profile`
   - Return to `/recruiter`
   - Should see normal dashboard with job posting functionality

3. **API Endpoints:**
   - `GET /api/recruiter/jobs` - Returns 403 with clear message if no profile
   - `GET /api/recruiter/jobs/stats` - Returns 403 with clear message if no profile

## Security Considerations

- The fix maintains proper authorization - users still cannot access recruiter functionality without a profile
- Error messages are informative but don't expose sensitive system information
- The role validation is now properly enforced at the middleware level

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding role-based routing middleware to automatically redirect users to profile creation
2. Add profile completion status indicators
3. Implement progressive profile setup with required vs optional fields
