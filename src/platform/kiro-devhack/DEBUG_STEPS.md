# Debug Steps for Dashboard Update Issue

## Current Status
- Job posting succeeds and shows success message
- Dashboard shows "No job postings yet" even after successful posting
- Need to identify where the disconnect is happening

## Debug Tools Added

### 1. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed logging to dashboard component
- Added logging to jobs API endpoint
- Added logging to job posting service
- Added logging to cache operations

### 2. Debug Endpoints
- `/api/debug/jobs` - Shows all jobs and recruiters in database
- `/api/debug/test-flow` - Tests complete job creation and retrieval flow

### 3. Dashboard Debug Buttons
- **Debug DB** - Shows total jobs and recruiters in database
- **Test Flow** - Creates a test job and tries to retrieve it
- **Refresh** - Forces cache bypass and refetches data

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Check Database State
1. Go to dashboard
2. Click "Debug DB" button
3. Check if jobs exist in database

### Step 2: Test Complete Flow
1. Click "Test Flow" button
2. This will:
   - Create a test job
   - Try to retrieve jobs for the same recruiter
   - Show if there's a mismatch

### Step 3: Check API Response Structure
1. Open browser dev tools
2. Go to Network tab
3. Click "Refresh" button on dashboard
4. Check the response from `/api/recruiter/jobs`

### Step 4: Check Console Logs
1. Open browser console
2. Look for logs starting with `[RECRUITER-DASHBOARD]`, `[RECRUITER-JOBS-GET]`, `[JOB-POSTING-SERVICE]`
3. Check for any errors or unexpected data structures

## Potential Issues to Look For

### 1. Recruiter ID Mismatch
- Job created with recruiter ID: X
- Dashboard fetching with recruiter ID: Y
- **Check**: Compare recruiter IDs in logs

### 2. API Response Structure
- Dashboard expects: `{ success: true, data: { jobs: [...] } }`
- API returns: `{ success: true, data: [...] }`
- **Check**: Look at API response structure in network tab

### 3. Cache Issues
- Cache not being invalidated after job creation
- Stale cache being returned
- **Check**: Look for cache hit/miss logs

### 4. Database Issues
- Job not actually being saved
- Job saved with wrong recruiter ID
- **Check**: Debug DB button results

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. Post job â†’ Success message
2. Auto-redirect to dashboard (10 seconds)
3. Dashboard shows new job in "Recent Job Postings"
4. Stats update to show increased job count
