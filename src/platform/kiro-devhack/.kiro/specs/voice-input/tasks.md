- [x] 3. Create voice input button component with visual states
  - Build VoiceInputButton component with microphone icon and state indicators
  - Implement visual feedback for idle, listening, processing, and error states
  - Add pulsing animation for recording state and loading spinner for processing
  - Create hover tooltips and accessibility attributes (ARIA labels)
  - Write component tests for all visual states and interactions
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1_

- [x] 4. Integrate voice button with existing input field layout
  - Modify SimpleChat component's input section to include voice button
  - Position voice button within or adjacent to the text input field
  - Ensure responsive design works on mobile and desktop devices
  - Maintain existing styling consistency with Tailwind CSS classes
  - Test layout integration across different screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.5_

- [x] 5. Implement real-time transcript updates in input field
  - Connect speech recognition results to the newMessage state in SimpleChat
  - Handle interim results display with visual indication (e.g., lighter text)
  - Replace interim text with final transcribed results as they arrive
  - Preserve user's ability to edit transcribed text before sending
  - Write integration tests for transcript flow from speech to input field
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.7_

- [x] 6. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
  - Implement permission request handling and user guidance for denied access
  - Create error messages for network issues, no speech detected, and service failures
  - Add retry mechanisms for recoverable errors
  - Display appropriate feedback messages with clear user instructions
  - Write tests for all error scenarios and recovery flows
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 1.6, 4.3, 4.4, 5.4_

- [x] 7. Implement microphone permission management
  - Handle browser's automatic permission prompt when getUserMedia is called
  - Create user-friendly messages for different permission states
  - Add fallback behavior when microphone access is unavailable
  - Implement proper error handling for permission-related failures
  - Test permission flows across different browsers
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 1.6, 5.5_

- [x] 8. Add loading states and processing feedback
  - Implement loading indicators during speech-to-text processing
  - Show visual feedback when transcription is in progress
  - Add confirmation feedback when transcription completes successfully
  - Create smooth transitions between different UI states
  - Write tests for loading state management and user feedback
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.4_

- [x] 9. Implement browser compatibility and graceful degradation
  - Add feature detection to hide/disable voice button on unsupported browsers
  - Create fallback messaging for browsers without Web Speech API support
  - Test functionality across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
  - Ensure mobile device compatibility with built-in speech recognition
  - Write compatibility tests for different browser environments
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 10. Add final integration testing and polish
  - Test complete user flow from voice button click to message sending
  - Verify real-time transcription works smoothly with interim and final results
  - Ensure voice input integrates seamlessly with existing chat functionality
  - Test mixed input scenarios (typing + voice) and editing capabilities
  - Perform cross-browser and mobile device testing
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 2.7, 5.5_
