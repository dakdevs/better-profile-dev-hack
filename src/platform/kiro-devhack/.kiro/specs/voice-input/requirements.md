# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds voice input capabilities to the chat interface, allowing users to speak their messages instead of typing them. The voice input functionality will be integrated directly into the existing text input field with a dedicated voice button, providing a seamless user experience for hands-free interaction with the chat agent.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click a voice input button to start recording my voice, so that I can speak my message instead of typing it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the voice input button THEN the system SHALL start recording audio from the user's microphone
2. WHEN recording starts THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating that recording is active
3. WHEN the user clicks the voice button again during recording THEN the system SHALL stop recording
4. IF the user's browser does not support microphone access THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN the system requests microphone access THEN the browser SHALL automatically prompt the user for permission
6. WHEN the user denies microphone permission THEN the system SHALL show a helpful message explaining how to enable microphone access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my spoken words to be converted to text and appear in the input field in real-time, so that I can see my words being transcribed as I speak.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recording starts THEN the system SHALL begin real-time speech recognition
2. WHEN the user speaks THEN the system SHALL continuously update the text input field with transcribed words as they are recognized
3. WHEN speech recognition produces interim results THEN the system SHALL display them in the input field with visual indication that they are provisional
4. WHEN speech recognition produces final results THEN the system SHALL replace interim text with the final transcribed text
5. WHEN recording stops THEN the system SHALL finalize all transcribed text in the input field
6. IF speech recognition fails during recording THEN the system SHALL display an error message and preserve any successfully transcribed text
7. WHEN transcribed text appears in the input field THEN the user SHALL be able to edit the text before sending

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice input button to be easily accessible within the text input area, so that I can quickly switch between typing and speaking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat interface loads THEN the voice input button SHALL be visible within or adjacent to the text input field
2. WHEN the voice button is not recording THEN it SHALL display a microphone icon
3. WHEN the voice button is recording THEN it SHALL display a different visual state (e.g., pulsing, different color, or stop icon)
4. WHEN the user hovers over the voice button THEN it SHALL show a tooltip explaining its function
5. WHEN the voice button is clicked THEN it SHALL provide immediate visual feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback about the voice input process, so that I understand what's happening and can use the feature effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recording starts THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator showing recording is active
2. WHEN the system is processing speech-to-text THEN it SHALL show a loading state
3. IF an error occurs during recording or transcription THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
4. WHEN transcription completes successfully THEN the system SHALL provide subtle confirmation feedback
5. WHEN the microphone is not available THEN the system SHALL disable the voice button and show why it's unavailable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice input to work reliably across different browsers and devices, so that I can use this feature regardless of my platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the feature loads THEN the system SHALL check for browser compatibility with Web Speech API
2. IF the browser doesn't support speech recognition THEN the system SHALL hide the voice button or show it as disabled
3. WHEN using the feature on mobile devices THEN it SHALL work with the device's built-in speech recognition
4. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts gracefully
5. WHEN multiple speech recognition requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle them properly without conflicts
