# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will establish comprehensive repository guidelines and tooling configuration for a Next.js TypeScript project. The goal is to create a well-organized development environment where any developer can immediately understand the structure, code quality is automatically maintained, and the development experience is smooth and consistent. This includes setting up linting, formatting, naming conventions, project structure, and automated workflows that catch mistakes early and maintain code standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive linting and formatting tools configured, so that code quality is automatically maintained and consistent across the entire codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `pnpm lint` THEN the system SHALL check all TypeScript and React files for code quality violations
2. WHEN a developer runs `pnpm lint:prettier` THEN the system SHALL check all files for formatting consistency
3. WHEN a developer runs `pnpm fix:prettier` THEN the system SHALL automatically format all files according to project standards
4. WHEN a developer runs `pnpm fix:eslint` THEN the system SHALL automatically fix all auto-fixable linting violations
5. IF linting or formatting violations exist THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with file locations and suggested fixes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized naming conventions enforced throughout the project, so that the codebase remains consistent and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating component files THEN the system SHALL enforce kebab-case naming (e.g., user-profile-card.tsx)
2. WHEN writing component names THEN the system SHALL enforce PascalCase (e.g., UserProfileCard)
3. WHEN writing variables and functions THEN the system SHALL enforce camelCase (e.g., getUserOrder, isVegetarian)
4. WHEN writing CSS classes THEN the system SHALL enforce kebab-case (e.g., menu-item, price-display)
5. WHEN writing constants THEN the system SHALL enforce UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_ORDER_SIZE)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a standardized project structure with clear organization, so that I can quickly locate and understand different parts of the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL place reusable UI components in src/components/
2. WHEN organizing utilities THEN the system SHALL place utility functions in src/lib/
3. WHEN organizing types THEN the system SHALL place TypeScript type definitions in src/types/
4. WHEN organizing styles THEN the system SHALL place global styles in src/styles/
5. WHEN importing local files THEN the system SHALL support path aliases using ~/ for src/ directory

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized import ordering and organization, so that imports are consistent and easy to read across all files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing in any file THEN the system SHALL order React/Next.js imports first
2. WHEN importing in any file THEN the system SHALL order third-party library imports second
3. WHEN importing in any file THEN the system SHALL order local imports with ~/ alias last
4. WHEN importing in any file THEN the system SHALL separate import groups with blank lines
5. IF import order is incorrect THEN the linting system SHALL flag the violation and provide auto-fix capability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript configured with strict mode and proper path resolution, so that type safety is maximized and imports are clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compiles THEN the system SHALL enforce strict mode for maximum type safety
2. WHEN using path aliases THEN the system SHALL resolve ~/* to ./src/* correctly
3. WHEN importing files THEN the system SHALL provide proper IntelliSense and auto-completion
4. IF type errors exist THEN the system SHALL prevent compilation and provide clear error messages
5. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL successfully compile without type errors

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated quality checks and fixes integrated into my workflow, so that code quality is maintained without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the development server THEN the system SHALL start without any linting or formatting errors
2. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL successfully compile and pass all quality checks
3. WHEN running quality checks THEN the system SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
4. IF quality issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide actionable feedback with specific file locations
5. WHEN using auto-fix commands THEN the system SHALL resolve issues without breaking existing functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and examples of the coding standards, so that I can follow the guidelines consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing project guidelines THEN the system SHALL provide clear examples of proper naming conventions
2. WHEN reviewing project guidelines THEN the system SHALL provide examples of proper import ordering
3. WHEN reviewing project guidelines THEN the system SHALL provide examples of proper component structure
4. WHEN reviewing project guidelines THEN the system SHALL provide a complete workflow checklist
5. IF guidelines are unclear THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance and common solutions
