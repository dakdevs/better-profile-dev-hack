# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a standalone grading system module that processes Q&A pairs from ongoing conversations and maintains a hierarchical topic tree structure. The system tracks conversation topics, their relationships, and optionally scores each Q&A pair while providing intelligent navigation through the conversation tree to guide continued learning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a conversation system, I want to process individual Q&A pairs and organize them into a topic tree, so that I can maintain context and structure throughout the conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Q&A pair is submitted THEN the system SHALL process it as a single unit
2. WHEN processing a Q&A pair THEN the system SHALL determine the primary topic from the content
3. WHEN a topic is identified THEN the system SHALL either add it to an existing branch or create a new branch
4. IF the topic relates to an existing topic THEN the system SHALL add it as a child node
5. IF the topic is unrelated to existing topics THEN the system SHALL create a new root branch

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a conversation system, I want to maintain a persistent topic tree structure, so that I can track the full conversation hierarchy across multiple interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the topic tree SHALL be initialized as empty
2. WHEN Q&A pairs are added THEN the tree structure SHALL persist for the entire conversation session
3. WHEN a new topic node is created THEN it SHALL store topic name, parent reference, and optional score
4. WHEN a root topic is created THEN the parent_topic SHALL be null
5. WHEN a subtopic is created THEN the parent_topic SHALL reference the appropriate parent node

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a conversation system, I want to track the depth of each topic from the root, so that I can understand the conversation's hierarchical structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a root topic is created THEN its depth SHALL be 1
2. WHEN a child topic is created THEN its depth SHALL be parent depth + 1
3. WHEN calculating depth THEN the system SHALL traverse from the node to the root
4. WHEN retrieving depth information THEN the system SHALL provide accurate depth values for any given node

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a conversation system, I want to optionally score each Q&A pair, so that I can evaluate the quality or relevance of different parts of the conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Q&A pair is processed THEN the system SHALL allow an optional score to be assigned
2. WHEN no score is provided THEN the score field SHALL be null
3. WHEN a score is provided THEN it SHALL be stored with the topic node
4. WHEN retrieving topic information THEN the score SHALL be included if available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an LLM system, I want to retrieve the deepest unvisited branch, so that I can continue the conversation in the most detailed unexplored area.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting the deepest unvisited branch THEN the system SHALL identify all leaf nodes
2. WHEN multiple leaf nodes exist THEN the system SHALL return the one with maximum depth
3. WHEN multiple nodes have the same maximum depth THEN the system SHALL return the first one found
4. WHEN all branches have been visited THEN the system SHALL indicate no unvisited branches remain
5. WHEN a branch is marked as visited THEN it SHALL not be returned in future deepest branch queries

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean API to interact with the grading system, so that I can easily integrate it into existing conversation systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a Q&A pair THEN the system SHALL provide an addQAPair function
2. WHEN determining topic relationships THEN the system SHALL provide internal logic to decide branch continuation vs new branch creation
3. WHEN calculating depth THEN the system SHALL provide a getDepthFromRoot function
4. WHEN retrieving navigation information THEN the system SHALL provide a getDeepestUnvisitedBranch function
5. WHEN accessing tree structure THEN the system SHALL provide methods to traverse and query the tree

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a conversation system, I want the scoring logic to be independent of the tree logic, so that I can modify scoring algorithms without affecting the tree structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing scoring THEN it SHALL be decoupled from tree construction logic
2. WHEN updating scoring algorithms THEN tree structure SHALL remain unaffected
3. WHEN tree operations are performed THEN they SHALL not depend on scoring implementation
4. WHEN scoring is disabled THEN all tree functionality SHALL continue to work normally
