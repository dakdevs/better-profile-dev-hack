# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Interview Management System is a comprehensive feature that enables candidates to set their interview availability and allows recruiters to post jobs, filter candidates, and schedule interviews. This system bridges the gap between candidate availability and recruiter needs, creating an automated matching and scheduling workflow.

The system consists of two main components: a candidate-facing availability management interface and a recruiter-facing job posting and candidate management system. The feature integrates with the existing user authentication, skills tracking, and database infrastructure.
