- **Error recovery**: Network errors, API failures, and permission issues handled gracefully
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, tooltips, and keyboard navigation work properly
- **Loading states**: Processing feedback and completion confirmations display correctly

**Key Test Cases:**
- Complete flow from voice button to message sending (18 tests)
- Multiple interim and final transcript results
- Error handling during voice input flow
- Permission denied scenarios
- Mixed typing and voice input
- Editing transcribed text
- Rapid voice button clicks
- Voice input during form submission
- Accessibility and user experience validation

### 2. Cross-Browser Integration Tests (`cross-browser-integration.test.tsx`)
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full functionality with webkit speech recognition
- **Safari**: Standard speech recognition API support
- **Firefox**: Graceful degradation with disabled voice button
- **Mobile browsers**: Touch interactions and responsive design
- **Insecure contexts**: Proper handling of HTTPS requirements
- **Performance testing**: Rapid state changes and long content handling

**Browser Support Matrix:**
- ✅ Chrome: Full support with webkit speech recognition

- ✅ Safari: Full support with standard speech recognition API
- ✅ Safari iOS: Full support with mobile optimizations
- ❌ Firefox: Graceful degradation (voice button disabled)
- ❌ Insecure contexts: Disabled with helpful guidance

### 3. Mixed Input Scenarios Tests (`mixed-input-scenarios.test.tsx`)
- **Complex input patterns**: Type → voice → type → voice workflows
- **Advanced editing**: Text selection, cursor positioning, backspace operations
- **Error handling**: Voice errors during typing, network failures
- **Performance**: Rapid mixed input changes, long content handling
- **State management**: Proper state transitions and cleanup

**Advanced Scenarios Tested:**
- Multiple voice sessions with interim results
- Typing during voice recording
- Text selection and replacement with voice
- Cursor positioning during voice input
- Undo/redo-like operations
- Error recovery in mixed scenarios
- Performance with rapid state changes

### 4. Browser Compatibility Tests (`browser-compatibility.test.ts`)
- **Feature detection**: Speech recognition, media devices, secure context
- **Browser identification**: User agent parsing and version detection
- **Mobile device detection**: Touch interface optimization
- **Error messaging**: Browser-specific guidance and recommendations
- **Graceful degradation**: Fallback behavior for unsupported browsers

### 5. Permission Integration Tests (`permission-integration.test.ts`)
- **Permission flow**: Request, grant, deny scenarios
- **Error handling**: Permission-related failures
- **State management**: Permission status tracking
- **Browser compatibility**: Different permission API implementations
